Do Not Build This

Getting Started
---------------

To get started with ParanoidAndroid, you'll need to get
familiar with [Git and Repo](http://source.android.com/download/using-repo).

To initialize your local repository using the ParanoidAndroid trees, use a command like this:

    repo init -u git://github.com/Puri321/manifest.git -b kitkat2.6

Then to sync up:

    repo sync

## Building ##

The bundled builder tool `./rom-build.sh` handles all the building steps for the specified device
automatically. As the device value, you just feed it with the device codename (for example,
'hammerhead' for the Nexus 5).

```bash
# Go to the root of the source tree...
$ cd WORKSPACE
# ...and run the builder tool.
$ ./rom-build.sh DEVICE
```
